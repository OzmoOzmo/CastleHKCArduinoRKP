More features being added.\r\n\r\n![Animation](http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/attachment.php?attachmentid=302051&stc=1&d=1396831399)\r\n\r\nThis project allows you to remote arm/disarm the panel as well as view logs etc.\r\nBasically everything that can be done from the real keypad.\r\n\r\nIt also Emails you when an Alarm happens.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo compile, place all in a folder called \"CastleHKCArduinoRKP\"\r\nand open the \"CastleHKCArduinoRKP.ino\" in Arduino IDE.\r\n\r\nNo libraries are required - just a standard Arduino IDE installation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circuit required to be made is in the HowTo Notes Folder.\r\n\r\nSee Config.h for any settings - such as email address to alert etc.\r\n\r\nTested on Uno and Leonardo.\r\nNote: UNO runs fine - but only Leonardo can Debug Log to Console.\r\n\r\nThe status of this project is being blogged at http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2057113381\r\n\r\nJune 2015\r\n","google":"UA-829906-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
