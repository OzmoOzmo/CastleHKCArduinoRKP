This project allows you to remote arm/disarm the panel as well as view logs etc.
Basically everything that can be done from the real keypad.

It also Emails you when an Alarm happens.


To compile, place all in a folder called "CastleHKCArduinoRKP"
and open the "CastleHKCArduinoRKP.ino" in Arduino IDE.

No libraries are required - just a standard Arduino IDE installation.


The circuit required to be made is in the HowTo Notes Folder.

See Config.h for any settings - such as email address to alert etc.

Tested on Uno and Leonardo.
Note: UNO runs fine - but only Leonardo can Debug Log to Console.

The status of this project is being blogged at http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2057113381
