CastleHKCArduinoRKP
=======================

A HKC SecureWatch Alarm compatible Remote Keypad that makes Alarm functions
accessible via any desktop or modern mobile phone browser.


Currently in the analysis stage - but hopefully the same functionality that exists with the CastleAritechArduinoRKP project can be made work here also.


ie. Allows you to remote arm/disarm the panel as well as view logs etc.
Also Emails you when an Alarm happens.


To compile, place all in a folder called "CastleAritechArduinoRKP"
and open the "CastleAritechArduinoRKP.ino" in Arduino IDE.

No libraries are required.


The circuit required is in the HowTo Notes Folder.
