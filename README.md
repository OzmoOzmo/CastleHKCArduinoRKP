CastleHKCArduinoRKP
=======================

A HKC SecureWatch Alarm compatible Remote Keypad that makes Alarm functions
accessible via any desktop or modern mobile phone browser.

Currently working. More features being added.


This project allows you to remote arm/disarm the panel as well as view logs etc.
Basically everything that can be done from the real keypad.

It also Emails you when an Alarm happens.


To compile, place all in a folder called "CastleHKCArduinoRKP"
and open the "CastleHKCArduinoRKP.ino" in Arduino IDE.

No libraries are required - just a standard Arduino IDE installation.


The circuit required to be made is in the HowTo Notes Folder.

The status of this project is being blogged on www.boards.ie
